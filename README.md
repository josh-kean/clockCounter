# clockCounter
intakes time in a MM.SS format, and returns the overall time in your choice of seconds, minutes, or hours
by default, there are three times loaded into the system as a list [12.31, 08.32, 15.47]
the user can click the "print seconds", "print minutes", or "print hours" buttons to display the equivilant minutes, seconds, or hours
the user can add a new time to the list by entering a time into the box below the below the button labeled "add time to list in ##.## format"

Current deficiencies are as follows;
time needs to be in ##.## format. This will be fixed in the near future
display shows all float decimals. I am deciding whether or not to change it to show rounded int values, or only the first 2 decimals
the format looks like it was made on a mac from 1994, i want to make it look more modern.
